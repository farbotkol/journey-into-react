# Journey into React
The project files for the Journey into React tutorial that I'm writing on my website, davidmeents.com. It is still in development and will be released shortly.

### Getting Started with React on Windows
After recently taking the plunge into React myself, I decided I would write a series of posts on my experience. I found that while there are countless well written articles on the subject, tutorials to follow, and the endless knowledge of professionals on Stack Overflow, getting a working knowledge of React was difficult and the process was convoluted. It's my hope that that this series of articles and their accompanying videos will make the learning curve a bit easier, and get you creating much faster.

I went into learning this language with a strong understanding of HTML, CSS, and JQUERY, as well as experience in C#. Even with this experience I initially found the concepts of React, Node, and all of their dependencies a bit overwhelming, so stick with it and you'll be creating your own apps in no time.

I'll also be referencing a few different tutorials I've found useful throughout my journey into React, in particular the one over at Slate Peak. I work closely with Josh on many projects, and his React tutorial is particularly useful for Mac users. As this tutorial will focus primarily on my experience with a Windows computer, his tutorial might be able to fill in any gaps that you Mac users may run into. That being said, this tutorial should be pretty friendly across all platforms.
